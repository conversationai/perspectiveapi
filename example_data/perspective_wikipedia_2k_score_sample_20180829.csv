I asked these questions because the answers to them are vital for impartial users of the site to make an informed decision.

You think the video you gave proves anything? You ended up contradicting yourself. If there's a song from the Rhodopes called Zajdi, zajdi it's Karavelov who plagiarized it as Bulka varvi iz gora zelena is awfully similar.

Rob cites Robert Trujillo of Metallica as an influence and Cioky names John Dolmayan of SOAD as a favorite drummer. Sethgar has named Daron Malakian, also of SOAD as a favorite guitarist.
The band plays a blend of multiple genres of metal: metalcore, thrash metal, gothic metal, industrial metal and death metal, but they don't always put all the styles into a single song. They rather blend two or three of these styles into one song, making it difficult for their songs to be catalogued as a specific genre.

My response: 

This is absolutely outrageous.  The ICC is virtually a home for torture: it is as bad as anything Mengeles thought up in the concentration camps: we're dealling with helpless children.  I have contacted the ICC in the past, and Columbia Presbyterian, and it was clear from my conversations with pediatric surgeons that staff there were ashamed of what they carried out: basically in vivo experiments which amounted to torture.

Wikipedia may have a neutral policy but the information you have inserted, and insisted on re-inserting, is wrong.  It may even lead to the death of more children by misleading people into believing the ICC is a safe home for children. It most certainly is not.  There were people such as yourself involved in the Inquisition and the SS!  You cannot defend a """"neutral"""" policy when it amounts to covering up the sadistic treatment of children.  You should be asbolutely ashamed of yourself.

I am not a vandal, I am a father of two, and I am the director of a company in the UK. I insist that Wikipedia stop glossing over the criminal, immoral, behaviour of the ICC.

LOL that the same admin who made the block reviews the unblock request.  Just a """"slight"""" conflict of interest.
I had only made a single edit to the page in question when this user abusively put a """"edit war"""" template on my page and then threatened to report me for saying he """"acted like he owned the page,"""" a justifiable statement when he reverted an edit that simply removed an unnecessary, obvious, redundant statement that did not alter the factual content of the article. Had it been an ongoing edit war, that would be different, but I made a SINGLE edit after a previous edit ten days ago.  That he would put an """"edit war"""" template on my page in response to a single edit that only dealt style and not factual content is pretty clear evidence of harassment that he believes he owns the page.
He continued to harass me on MY OWN talk page.  How are my responses on MY OWN TALK PAGE considered """"trying to harass another user???""""

The opening to this article needs to be completely rewritten. First of all, the last successful invasion was the Norman attack in 1066, which led to the Battle of Hastings. It is not an invasion if you are invited. The English populace asked him to come with an army to dispose of their monarch, James II. How can it be an invasion if you invite someone to come? If someone smashes your windows in, that is burglary. If you invite them in, its not burglary is it? Look at the Texas Revolution. Some blind idiots assume that as an Anglo-American invasion of the Mexican state of Tejas. Yet the Mexican government invited them, so how is it an invasion if you are invited? Also, how is this seen as the birthplace of British democracy. First of all, James II wasn't trying to gain absolute power the way Charles I did. He did not close Parliament for one, and he did not pass laws without the consent of his people. He was unpopular with his subjects because he was Catholic, not because he was trying to assume total power. The birthplace of British democracy was in 1645, in the form of the Battle of Naseby and the culmination of the English Civil War. It was after that war in which British democracy had been born. Never again after that would a monarch try to rule without the consent of his people. James II did nothing of the sort which Charles I did. It was only due to his religious orientations (and thus, ties with the Pope) which made him unpopular. This article needs to be seriously re-written.

The text of the article says: """"...reputed to be from Persia (Iran)...""""

Why reputed? It's a fact. The Persian cat is ubiquitous in Iran and can be seen digging garbage cans for food in city alleys and streets there everywhere. Theyre indigenous.

In Iran, the """"Persian cat"""" is called """"Gorbeh Yazdi"""" (since non-Persian regular breeds also exist).

My mother had one once when she was little in Shiraz. He was named """"Montesquieu"""" by my grandpa. My grandma however threw the Cat out back into the streets because he would pee on the Persian rugs of the house.

I became friends with one myself when I was a kid in Isfahan once. I called her """"khaleh fery"""". She was a full size beauty. And she ate one of my Turkey chicks we were raising in our backyard. But she gave birth to two lovely kittens. I tried raising them, but they had to eventually go back to the alley because my mom would not tolerate the fur balls and hair on the rugs in the house (oh history). When I moved to America, I had to leave them both to tend for themselves. One kitten got run over by a car, and the other was killed by mad kids in the street, I was told later on.

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me.

NB: Settleman, from recently you have started adding material from both sides but you don't comply with NPoV yet anyway. You have some ideas of what is the pov of opponents to some Israeli policies but when you write an article on such a topic, it is not enough to google for some articles about what they say. You have to understand their arguments as well as you understand those that you share/listen day-to-day and put all of them in article in order that everybody understand them. You also have to introduce their arguments """"fairly"""" so that they can be understood.
The big issue [for you] will be that on the statistical point of view, you should face 50% of time arguments from the other side partly stronger than the ones you believe in. How will you manage this if your are pro-Israel and revendicate this or the right to be so on wp ?

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN. I would suggest that you not re-insert, as you will not want to get caught up in this. The next person to re-insert it will be reported to WP:AE.

Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it?

Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

Over four hours??? Guess what I was doing during the four hours between 1:00am and 5:00am last night? Sleeping. Wikipedia is an international website with editors from all over the world; not everyone will have an opportunity to respond to a talk page comment at any given moment. People work. People study. People eat. And, yes, people sleep. Some people will edit every three hours; others will edit every three days. You cannot just say that because no one has commented in four hours a discussion is closed. I'd suggest waiting five to seven days after the conclusion of a conversation before considering it closed. 300 (film) is a very active article and there clearly are a lot of matters that are as of yet unsettled. The fact that a talk page has reached a certain size is not an automatic license to archive the page, particularly when there is unfinished business. Regarding your pending three-revert rule violation, all of your reverts to 300 (film) contribute to the rule unless you are reverting simple vandalism. That is not what you are doing; you are reverting legitimate edits, so clearly """"consensus"""" has not yet been reached.

 Angel 

Well, yeah I'm a bit miffed to be honest. It's okay. Buffy Season Eight is a barrel of godly goodness, and by comparison Angel feels like Amazons Attack. Characterizations are off, I'm afraid. Connor's introduction felt ... crappy. Wesley's been introduced in the wrong way - don't jump him into a new role and backtrack characterization, do a Giles where you see him maybe two panels at a time and flesh him out through his own internal monologue. Lynch is a Spike fan, and he's projecting weird lusty desires onto Spike (vicariously?) - although Spike's not above the occasional Buffybot, it seems so strange. Strangest of all is Illyria. I would imagine she would either be desolate and destructive, walking about town killing without rest, or in some way secluded and shattered. For some reason it reminds me of Marvel vs. DC, where writers decided """"why introduce them cleverly? just have them start wailing on each other!"""" I also am trying my hardest to like Urru's style, but personally I think Jeanty and Lee are so much better, the slightly cartoony style better captures the tone of the series. Perhaps somebody like Nicola Scott would have been a better choice for Angel (by bizarre coincidence, going on her page after recommending her, she's done Illyria comics for IDW before!).

I'd say a good quality of the series is Betta George. I think 12 issues may be too long if this is the pace Lynch is going to have, and I'd have liked to see another writer try the Fight Night double-issue. I hate these publisher-exclusive contracts - I wish Geoff Johns or somebody could give it a go. I feel the book needs more pace, and better humour.

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term.

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

Deleting my page Ahontoay was not necessary. I read the reason for the page's deletion and the following may help you learn more information about this group of non treaty Montana Chippewa Indians. You claimed you searched for anything about Ahontoay on wikipedia. You can try searching by using the name Ahonteways but it won't work. Search by using the phrase User:Linniebc/SandBox. That will quickly lead you to the wikipedia page with A-Hon-Te-Ways. Though the phrase is a wikipedia's contributor's name, it is the only way you'll find it. That is the only wikipedia page with that name. The Ahontoay are a non federally recognized group of Chippewa's in Montana. The United States has no jurisdiction over them. 

The only way to find out about this group of non treaty Chippewa's, is by using google or another search engine. Google Ahontoay and you will find that the name is spelt as Ahontoay. The wikipedia page spells it as Ahonteways, which is not the correct way of spelling the chiefs name on the historical records i have found on the internet. Don't get the two names Ahontoay and Ahonteways, mixed up. They are not two different peoples but the same people. Chief Ahontoay did not take treaty. He never lived on a Reservation which proves he refused to cooperate with the United States. You will have to deal with the obvious difference in name spelling. It is not right to delete my page because it is not a hoax. It is based on real historical events.

Even former Foreign Minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, says in his book, Scars of War, Wounds of Peace, that there was an ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians:

The reality on the ground... was that of an Arab community in a state of terror facing a ruthless Israeli army whose path to victory was paved not only by its exploits against the regular Arab armies, but also by the intimidation, and at times atrocities and massacres, it perpetrated against the civilian Arab community. A panic-stricken Arab community was uprooted under the impact of masacres that would be carved into the Arabs' monument of grief and hatred... Benny Morris['s] thesis about the birth of the refugee problem being not by design but by the natural logic and evolution of the war is not always sustained by the very evidence he himself provides...Ben-Gurion...also instructed that abandoned Arab villages needed to be settled by Jews even before the end of hostilities.... Israel's formal rejection of the refugees' claim for return — a position that remains intact to this day — rather than the expulsion and dispossession, is the real defining moment of the conflict..

Israel as a society also suppressed the memory of its war against the local Palestinians because it could not really come to terms ith the fact that its finest Sabras, the heroes of its war for independence and the role models of the new nation, expelled Arabs, committed atrocities against them, and dispossessed them.

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

 The apotropaic powers of inscriptions 

""""Äpotropaic"""" means """"to turn away"""": the idea was that a demon could be turned away from a house etc by displaying a holy text (or at least a magical text) near the door. The inscription therefore had to be clearly visible - at head-level, and outside the door (no point in letting your demon come inside before he could read the magic). The Tel Yayit stone doesn't fulfill these criteria: it was being used in an internal wall, inside a dark room, was about 3 feet off the ground, and was very faint. The archaeologists who found it missed it themselves until the last day of excavation, when they just happened to see it early one morning in ideal conditions, in the low raking light of the rising sun. Tho the setting sun would have done just as well. But the point is, in a dark room 3 feet off the ground, no demon is going to see it or read it, and even if he were a midget-demon, he's already inside, so what's the point?

A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol.

I wan't sure why you removed the info from the box at Palo Negro Airport.

 Zambo Article  
Hi Peridon,

I notice you've removed the speedy deletion tag I put on the Zambo Article.  As requested, I have provided sources in the discussion page which I will repeat below for your review and consideration:

African Languages and Ebonics by Dr. Katherine Harris, Central Connecticut State University.  Africa Update. Vol. IV, no. 3 (Summer 1997) Pan-African Language Patterns Revisited:  

""""The erosion of African names also occurred. Samba, meaning comfort in Wolof, is still recalled in musical form in Brazil, where there remains a strong African presence. A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

Here is television interview of the man: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=295lG-1Ugww 

This article must be deleted immediately or a disambiguation tag added to it (as in the Samba Dance article).  I call for the former because the name is African in origin and in African society, it does not mean what this article is purporting it to mean.

Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau. Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered.

National Journal rates Obama the single """"most liberal"""" member of the Senate last year, spotlighting some policy differences, as well as writing a GOP attack ad if he's the nominee, but perhaps also a helpful note in consolidating support on the left now.

The rating is a detailed, rigorous look across candidates' Senate records, and while Obama and Clinton are perceived as having similar Senate records, this suggests that Obama's record on the smaller, little-noticed votes has put him firmly to Clinton's left.

In this case the editor hasn't even edited after ClueBot's warning so I'm not altogether sure why another warning was issued.

Dear Mr. Lawrence or Mr. Ramirez or whoever you may be:

Your email to me requesting your IP address be unblocked failed to instill any trust. You claim to be one person (Lawrence), yet you send me email from an address that clearly belongs to another (Ramirez)? Are all accounts at your organization as compromised as your Wikipedia account has been?

You state """"It is not possible for me to set up another account on another IP address because this is my IP address."""" No, it is not your IP address. It belongs to your organization. And your organization has lost the trust of the Wikipedia community, with its history of promotional edits and multiple people accessing the same account.

 The Royal Waggon Train

 Metasemiotics 

As a journal editor myself, I often hear complaints from authors whose articles were rejected that """"the reviewer did not understand what we were writing"""". The answer is simple: this usually means that the article was not written intelligibly. I have nothing against metasemiotics, but an article that cannot be understood by the average reader will not be of much use to Wikipedia. Honestly, I could make head nor tail of that article. Material published in my own journal could not be placed in Wikipedia without heavy editing either. So my proposal for speedy deletion of your article is no reflection on the quality of the academic journals that you listed. It's just a reflection of the fact that you did not succeed in conveying what metasemiotics is about in generally understandable words. Apparently I was not the only one feeling this way, as the article was deleted by an admin who apparently agreed with me (I am not an admin and therefore cannot delete articles myself). In any case, it was only a speedy delete, so nothing prevents you from trying again. Please keep in mind in that case the public or which you are writing. Happy editing!

 This is what I have  edited the Picardi article to. 

John C. Picardi is the author of the plays The Sweepers, and Seven Rabbits on a Pole.  His plays are published by Samuel French and have been produced off-Broadway at Urban Stages in Manhattan and across the United States. Sweepers received positive reviews in the Los Angeles Times. The LA Times (The Sweepers)  Lawrence Van Gelder of the New York Times favorably reviewed both plays.  Van Gelder said about Sweepers that """"Mr. Picardi's writing renders his characters timeless"""". His review of  Seven Rabbits on a Pole opened with """"An epic is in the making"""".

Wow, interesting information.  First, let me say that I don't doubt the truth of what you're saying.  However, because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source, it qualifies as original research, which is not permitted on Wikipedia.  Typically, this type of information would have to be removed from an article.  Given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation, however, I'll leave it in with the """"citation needed"""" tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon (I'll look tomorrow).  I feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source, however, another editor could come along and justifiably remove it.

Kane's secrecy?
quote from the article:
""""if the Allied campaign were to be completed in Red Alert, the Allies would emerge victorious and the time line would instead lead into the events of Red Alert 2. It should be noted however that this theory is in direct contradiction to the original Tiberian Dawn manual, which states that Nod is an African group in its origin, making no mention of the Soviet Union whatsoever.""""
if the instruction manual was written by GDI, then perhaps they were simply deceived into what the origins of Nod were.  Maybe Kane planted information stating that it was from Africa; or maybe it really WAS from Africa, and Kane's attempts to drum up support in the USSR were unsuccessful.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to conflict, especially if it could be established that the manual was a GDI document, and therefore biased and uninformed.

If you look at this page's history you'll see a guy called Blofeld recently made a couple of very bizarre edits. The guy then decided he was an expert on what is probably the most obscure sultanate ever to have existed.

But this is silly. You should know already that there's a rather pitiful clique on this website.

Some things I'd like to mention. The reason Japan isn't listed as a potential superpower is because they lack the ability to project military power throughout the world, which is one of the key aspects of being a superpower. They have no nuclear arsenal, and according to their own constitution they're not allowed to use their military for anything other than defending their own country. There is far more to being a superpower than having a strong economy, but even then, their economy has been seeing stagnation as of late whereas India, China and Russia have been seeing economic growth of 8%-11% over the past few years.

As for Russia and India being failed states, that's not true either. Just look at this list. Neither country is listed. 

And perhaps you saw those other links I posted about poverty and education. Russia has far less poverty, and is far better educated than China. You grouping Russia in with India in terms of poverty and education just makes no sense at all when you look at real world statistics and real facts.

So I hope you didn't take my reverts the wrong way, but as I've shown you, your edits do not reflect """"common sense"""" as you put it, and they do not reflect the real world.

Hi Kryzstof, greetings to you and thank you for your invitation to feel free to ask you about any clarifications about Wikipedia. I would like to ask you how can I (or some administrator) change back the wrong presentation of the South Slavic languages and dialects division, placed in the chart, which is placed in the right side of the articles about Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Bunjevac and Serbo-Croatian language? 
In the chart named 'Chart of South Slavic languages and dialects' someone has changed the basically known fact that the politically created standards of the SerboCroatian language, such as Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Bunjevac, etc., they all belong to the Central South Slavic languages, and they don't belong in the same group with Slovenian language (which is Western group of South Slavic Languages). Please if you can, help me correct back this factual state of the things in this chart, because like it is now - it gives a wrong information to the readers. It should be like it was before,-showing: Serbian, Croatian, Bunjevac, and Bosnian in the SAME group of dialects, and that group is CENTRAL South Slavic Diasystem. Thanks;

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0.23,0.14,0.21,0.18,0.16,0.17,0.66,0.46,0.11,0.05,0.33,0.08,0.44,0.32,0.36,0.06,0.25,0.27

As an editor, you already know that RS is Wikipedia-editor shorthand for """"independent reliable source"""", as in WP:RS. Every statement made in a Wikipedia article, unless it is an obvious one like """"the sky is blue"""", should be WP:V verifiable (policy), meaning supported by independent WP:reliable sources (strong guideline).

We paraphrase, quote, and cite them. What you wrote has not been explicitly discussed in the media (yet).
2nd point: we don't write about Wikipedia or internal matters unless independent reliable sources have done so; to do so again sets up WP (or an editor) as an authority. 
3rd point: See WP:BURDEN], which spells out that it is the duty of the adding editor to cite reliable sources supporting the claim.  If none exist, the claim must not be added to a Wikipedia article.   """,0.08,0.06,0.18,0.12,0.13,0.14,0.31,0.47,0.05,0.02,0.26,0.03,0.83,0.05,0.30,0.01,0.83,0.29

Hi, Fred. I saw your note on Sammy's page and wanted to reply. (If you recall, I was the one who got the photo from you a few months back.) First of all, I'm very sorry to hear about Sammy's second stroke - I live in Los Angeles now so I'm often out of touch with what's happening in the Hudson Valley. Please pass along my best wishes.

Anyway, it seems the problems you pointed out in the article are errors of omission, rather than factual errors, so I just want to clarify them with you. 

First, you want the article to mention that your brother found him and brought him to you to bring to Imus, correct? 

Second, the discography section is completely empty, so please don't take it personally that your albums aren't there. It did not exist at all when I first wrote the article, and someone recently created the section but didn't put anything in it.

Am I understanding you correctly on both points? Assuming I can find reliable sources for this info, I will do my best to update it by the weekend. By the way, every page has a talk page (if you look at the top, it's under the tab marked """"discussion""""). The best way to communicate is to use talk pages, rather than editing the article itself. This is your personal discussion page, so you can reply to me here if you want to talk.

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship? I don't know here.

1. That he was the King of Āryāvarta
2. His influence reached till Indus River

If you go through the histories and historic maps properly then you will find that King Cyrus has never Indus. And as far as  Āryāvarta is concerned then it starts from Indus and spreads over Gangetic Plains. In history it can be clearly seen that there was no influence of King Cyrus on these areas. In fact King Cyrus' kingdom extended till today's Baluchistan province in Pakistan but have never reached till Indus River.Even the maps this article contains proves the same thing.

As a U.S. citizen, I can say that there are really TWO (or more) groups of whites in the U.S. The largest group is the so-called """"Anglo"""" Americans, which includes English, Irish, Scottish, and other north-western European groups. There is also the """"ethnic whites"""" who include Jews, Greeks, Slavs, Hispanics, etc... The fundamental difference is that by and large, """"Anglos"""" have been here much longer, and have fewer ties to their """"mother countries."""" Ethnic whites, on the other hand, tend to have more exotic names and traditions, and have more ties to their ancestral countries (still speak the language, celebrate the holidays, etc...) Most Americans have a hard time understanding the concept of white in Latin America, because our familiarily lies primarily with Mexico, which has a mestizo majority. Also, most Latin Americans in the United States identify themselves as """"Latinos"""" and not as whites, even though they may be. However, regardless of what Americans consider white to be, people of significant European or other Mediterrenean-area descent in Latin America would be white by anyone's standard.

I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism: 

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well.

 Replaceable fair use Image:Douglasduncan.jpg 

Thanks for uploading Image:Douglasduncan.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that fair use images which could be replaced by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted 7 days after this notification, per our Fair Use policy.

The template generates a link to Hayward (disambiguation) that then gets redirected to Hayward because the article was moved.

Laveol: Even last name Kolisev is a Macedonian one. Last names ending with """"ev"""", """"ov"""" are not Bulgarian. It happens that you have those in Bulgaria. But you have those last names in Macedonia, Russia, Check Republic, and so on.

Kolisev is a Macedonian last name. Same is Kolisevski. You can find both kinds with """"ov|ova"""", """"ev|eva"""", """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""" and others in Republic of Macedonia. So changing a last name from Kolisev to Kolisevski does not have any Bulgarian/AntiBulgarian implications. My last name is """"Janev"""". You can find in Macedonia also """"Janevski"""", """"Janeski"""". All of those are Macedonian last names. The fact that you can have """"Janev"""" in Bulgaria does not translate to ethnicity/origin claims in Macedonia.

Here are some last names that finish on """"ov"""", """"ev"""" and are not Bulgarian neither Macedonian:

[Sergei Lavrov]
[Anton Chekhov]
[Martina Navratilova]

So these last name endings are typical but not exclusive for some of the Slavic languages.
Same is with """"vski/vska"""", """"ski/ska"""", """"ich"""" which are shared between a number of Slavic languages.

To come back to Kolisevski: Kolisevski is a Macedonian last name, as well is Kolisev. If you can find a person living in Bulgaria with one of those last names, and probably you could not, does not gives any conclusion about ethnicity or being a Pro-Bulgarian.

 Same-sex marriage in the United States 

I've undone your revert on the intro to this article, because although it's in good faith, I think it's mistaken. The reason you gave was that the information is elsewhere in the article, which is already long, so the intro shouldn't cover it even in summary, as it's in the main body under """"History"""". Although I respect your intent of keeping it concise and avoiding redundancy, the Manual of Style for the intro is quite clear:
 The lead serves as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important aspects ... [It] should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies ... The lead is the first part of the article most people read, and many only read the lead.

The issue here is that the intro currently says that state bans were declared unlawful in 2015, 38+ states provided some rights as from 2003, and Windsor gave federal rights in 2013. There needs to be some mention of the backdrop and prior controversies as they were huge, and an increase from 2 to 3 paras to add substance on the background + context is (in my view) appropriate: even very long articles still need a proper introduction that summarizes their contents. Take a look at African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68) for an example of the intro to a long-ish article.

 Advice on editing 

I see that you have had what must be an unencouraging start to editing Wikipedia, with several articles you have created being deleted, and others replaced by redirects to existing articles. My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won't have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

Where uncommon terms are essential to describing the subject, they should be placed in context, briefly defined, and linked. The subject should be placed in a context with which many readers could be expected to be familiar. For example, rather than giving the latitude and longitude of a town, it is better to state that it is the suburb of some city, or perhaps that it provides services for the farm country of xyz county. Readers should not be dropped into the middle of the subject from the first word; they should be eased into it. It doesn't matter which List guideline you look at, they all refer back to WP:LEAD.

Image Tagging Image:Richard photo.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Richard photo.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 British Museum stuff 

I've removed:""""In the British Museum there is a genealogy in a manuscript of the Cottonian Collection showing a lineage of Gruffydd ap Cynan. It shows he is the father of Owain Gwynedd and the grandfather to Madawc (another spelling for Madoc). Also in the same collection is a Latin manuscript Vita Griffini Regis (The life of King Gruffydd) that says Gruffydd is the son of Cynan ab Iago and father to Owain Gwynedd - and Owain's son found unknown lands."""" Earlier I removed """"This manuscript as talked about in the Cottonian Collection has a date on it of 1477"""". 
First, there are quite a few Madocs/Madogs/Madawcs etc, so genealogies are of not much use here.
Secondly, why are we claiming that the manuscript says this without a link to it? There is an annotation that says """" Vita Griffini, filii Conani, regis Venedotiae vel Northwalliae, à Thelwello jurisperito Latine versa: ad finem carmina reperiuntur Meredithi de Madoco, filio Oweni Gwynnedd, et ejus navigatione ad terras incognitas; Wallice. Vixit Meredithus iste circa An. 1477"""". Note that this is not a date on the manuscript. We need a reliable source that has actually read the manuscript as the annotation fails as an RD (as clearly does Deacon.

The reality is that free software just wants to survive in a hererogenous network based on open standards to ensure interoperability with everyone else; while Microsoft has a 90% share of desktops and is leveraging this to displace open standards in an attempt to kill free software.

 The Microsoft-Novell agreement is completely irrelevant, because (1) Microsoft owns just two of the 125 patents in the VC-1 licensing pool, and is not in a position to license the other 123 to Novell, Linux or anyone else; and (2) Novell is not Linux. It is one of hundreds of companies that work in whole or in part in the Linux arena. None of the others benefit in any way from the agreement. On the contrary, the agreement is generally being interpreted by the Linux community as a threat.
 Ffmpeg stuff is legally dodgy in the USA because that jurisdiction has software patents.

If an Ori ship is piloted via a control chair like Ancient tech is does that mean that priors have the Ancient gene, meaning that O'Neill or someone else with the gene could fly it or is it only pilotable by people with powers of a prior?

 

There are many genes to choose from, and it is highly unlikely that the Ori chose the same one as (or one directly compatible with) the Alterans. The priors are tampered with so much, and they have telekinetic and other mental abilities, and piloting probably requires a number of those powers.

Hi, Joe,D. I'm here about one of the AfDs you handled. I think it's a fairly straightforward one, closed a little early, easy to work out how the user's points were evaluated mostly.

I was thinking it may be one I'd take to del reviewpossibly maybe. The thing being, several sources I've found didn't come up in the AfD. Those that've come to light are established print mags generally, made up of about 4 languages (jp, fr, de, zh etc). Some are interviews (I know how you feel about them ), a few are articles with some critical analysis amongst them. There's also coverage in a book (coffee-table type granted, but'd be a few paragraphs on the person & seems to be independent/legit at least).

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

Given the unique nature of comicbook material, we give them leeway on relying a good deal on primary sources.  It's only when those articles seeks something beyond a C, such as GA or FA status that third-party sources become imperative.  Now give, many of the minor superhero character pages out there are really stubs with little future, it's all about where you stand on the inclusionist/deletionist philosophy on Wikipedia.  Do you give leeway to small-interest articles in because we have nearly infinite resources, or do you hold everything to the rules?  Personally, I lean more toward keeps than deletes, except for extreme cases.

In any case, I Rictor may pass for GA.  You can check out a similar character I worked on and moved to GA (Anole (comics)).  That really go there because I trimmed through FCH, and had a lot of third party sources on some plot lines that involved him and the character's creation.  The layout for an FA article would probably cut through a lot of character history and focus on publication history.  It offends some people to see what they consider """"notable character history"""" cut, but if you want an accessible article, you have to do it.  Superman arguably has a ton of character history, but it's really just distilled down to the basic iconic things that others write about: Krypton, orphan, country boy, Metropolis, Louis Lane, Lex Luther, Justice League, etc.  I'm trying to find the time to do the same to Jean Grey.  I populated her Publication History, and that means ripping out a lot of that enormous Character History section.  Just some musings.

Hi,
Your page is the ONLY reference I have found for removing the left sidebar.  Really excited about this.

Found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PleaseStand/Hide_Vector_sidebar

Can you expand on the install instructions?  I did not add it to 'User:myname/vector.js', but instead 'User:myname/common.js'.  This didn't exist before I created it.

Also why have the vector skin check at the end if it is added to the skin javascript directly?  I just realized I added it to global first, and the check did work.  Moving it over to vector.js now...

I fumbled through but expanded instructions may help others.

Also, the shortcut key does not work to un-hide on Macs.  Not that I want to unhide it...
I could not figure out what to edit in the code to change the shortcut keys.

It also loads after all of the page content, is there a way to load it before so the sidebar doesn't appear then disappear, or edit the skin directly?

 2011 British GP team orders 

Before this turns into an edit conflict, what needs to be considered is that stating 'Vettel finished second after ...team orders...' incorrectly implies that he finished second because of those team orders. Since Webber himself admits that he ignored the team orders and still tried to overtake Vettel, IF it needs to be included, it needs to be reworded:
Although Vettel's KERS was malfunctioning at times, he was able to pass Massa on the track and took back second place. After a strong charge from Mark Webber towards the end, Webber was asked to """"maintain the gap"""" and not try to make a move on Vettel. Although Webber ignored his team's requests and tried to pass Vettel, Vettel was able to hold him off and finish second behind Alonso.http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/grand-prix-2011/frustrated-mark-webber-ignored-team-orders-in-vettel-chase/story-fn7r7gmb-1226092001816""",0.16,0.08,0.22,0.12,0.09,0.16,0.25,0.45,0.06,0.02,0.02,0.01,0.75,0.14,0.29,0.11,0.19,0.22

I have removed the self reference (However, they cited this Wikipedia entry for the background of the event (that explains the scripted nature) as the same way the government functions.) to Wikipedia (again) for a couple of reasons:
While not explicitly covered in Wikipedia:Manual of Style (self-references to avoid), in general it says to avoid referencing Wikipdia in articles that are not about Wikipedia or those involved with it.
While the NBC sports article is referencing Wikipedia, Wikipedia is not considered a reliable source as it is user generated content.  
That NBC sports cited the Wikipedia article on WWE Capitol Punnishment is really not relevant to the event.
The whole thing is a circular reference.  Wikipedia reports on WWE→NBC cites Wikipedia→Wikipedia cites NBC as citing Wikipedia.  So really it is Wikipedia citing itself, and again, Wikipedia is not a reliable source.

 Refs tag removed 

I've removed the 'references needed' tag because I think there are sufficient references here now for a short article - and to recognise  good work in improving this article. I've put in 'citation needed' tags at points in the article itself, which will need an in-line citation adding. The references section at the end needs to be Harvard-style (Author, title, date, city, publisher) rather than a list of URLs. The way to do this is like in the article on Jerry Fodor, which has in-line citations in the text linked to the full references at the end. If you go to the Fodor article and try to edit it, you will see what the syntax looks like.

I've also added the 'Philosopher' box from the Fodor page, but don't know what to put in it! I'm sure Aedan can fill it out authoritatively. I'll also find some categories to add this article to.

I think that the article's current appeal to outside rankings is far better than the previous statement of fact that Yale is """"one of the most prestigious universities in the world"""".  However, as a Yalie, I am worried that this is merely a product of Yale's inferiority complex.  The Harvard article backs up its claims of prominence and prestige by noting its vast resources and award-winning faculty, not by appealing to college ranking guides.

To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.
If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article.

Short question: I know that we are supposed to use care when dealing with primary sources... in the case of this article, the subject has published several books himself that detail some of his spiritual teachings. I was wondering if we can use these and if you have any advice for doing so in a way that remains unbiased and neutral.

 Songs and singles 
I've only just become aware of your post at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs#Articles should be about singles.2C not songs and think you've hit the nail on the head, there is a difference in what the guidance is for songs and singles compared to consensus. I had been interested in the project and made this point there some time back but couldn't get over this stumbling block and went elsewhere. Although I think it's a case of songs and singles - and that using (single) where there is an overarching article for the song might be a good solution in some cases. melmac """,0.07,0.03,0.08,0.07,0.07,0.13,0.27,0.33,0.05,0.01,0.02,0.01,0.46,0.01,0.27,0.10,0.95,0.23

 Noted unwanted behavior

But you can quibble about what """"religion"""" means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.

Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g.

 Few clarifications 

Hi Nichalp,

I am busy doing the changes you suggested. Meanwhile, I have a few doubts and would be happy if you can resolve them.

First of all, what is the difference between GFDL(GNU Free Documentation License) and PD(Public Domain). I have already seen the articles on them without any success in understanding the difference. Aren't GFDL documents open to public use? All the images created by me are tagged , but I don't have any idea if  would be more appropriate or not.

Secondly, I couldn't understand the context of your saying """"IITB also has a geology department. Please check."""" Even if it does have one, where should the changed be made, if at all they are to be done since this is a very minor issue.

Thirdly, I would be happy if you can suggest some neutral title to """"Success story"""". Few of my attempts have been reverted by other authors as they felt the titles suggested by me are inappropriate. Even I feel so, but I have no clue what would be most appropriate.

Thanks,

Someone who has not seen this 'alphabet' used in practise before could conclude from the table and the examples provided that it is a more or less fixed transliteration system for Modern Standard Arabic. In reality, however, it is almost always used to transliterate spoken Arabic, i.e. dialects, and there is an enormous amount of variation. For example, contrary to what the table suggests, both س and ص are usually represented by 's'; the distinction by using a capital 'S' for ص looks very neat, but I have never seen it in use. I would therefore suggest to provide more realistic examples, such as: (Lebanese) kif/keef sa7tak, chou/shu 3am ta3mil? weyn baddak nitghada? etc. Maybe it should also be noted that - in parallel with Arabic writing - there is a tendency to omit vowels.79.219.118.88",0.07,0.03,0.16,0.06,0.04,0.13,0.18,0.38,0.03,0.02,0.01,0.00,0.69,0.01,0.21,0.01,0.44,0.12

 Some Issues (which I'm about to attempt to partially fix) 

1. The gold-leaf and quadrant electrometers are in a sense, also repulsion electrometers; they both work by measuring the repulsion of the same charge in one way or another.

2. My 1861 chem textbook uses the name """"quadrant electrometer"""" to describe a considerably simpler device than Kelvin invented. This device has an index which goes between 0 and 90 degrees (hence a quadrant) while Kelvin's device, while I don't fully understand it, had a drum split into quadrants. So I conclude that this is a coincidence. 

The best solution I can think of is to create a section of repulsion electrometers, and then describe the types individually in their own sections underneath, e.g. gold-leaf, Dellmann, Peltier, Bohnenberger. I will rename """"quadrant electrometer"""" to """"Kelvin's quadrant electrometer"""", and then put both his and the simpler one under """"repulsion electrometers"""".

Hopefully we can make this article clearer and neater.

Just because some one writes books and they are used as sources in articles is not a good way to determine primary use.  I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.  So while that is not a good way of proving primary use, in this case it makes a strong case that there is no obvious primary use so the dab page should be moved.

While the """"circle notation"""" for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it. The """"Kekule notation"""" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and """"electron pushing"""" much more straightforward.

As I've already said, there was a similar drop in Putin's popularity before the 2004 elections, so that's not a new story. Reflecting in the lead every up and down in Putin's ratings is a heavy WP:RECENTISM and WP:Undue weight. Also, as was already said in the discussions above, there are different explanations to the booing story - reflecting them all means putting too much weight to this trivial event, while not reflecting them means non-neutral coverage. At the same event Putin was applauded, and it is not clear who was the person the booing was directed at. It's a sign of bias and yellow press style, and it's quite a pity that BBC and likes put so much attention to this episode. Note that Putin's popularity started decline before that event, and while I don't know the latest opinion polls, it is clear that if the popularity goes up that would be against the theory that that episode was somehow significant, while if the popularity goes down, that would be likely connected to the elections story rather than to some trivial episodes.

I smell trouble brewing.  Let's figure this out before an edit war starts.  I see a few issues here in dispute: 
1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: """"The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.""""

2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.  I personally think that most ponies are draft-type, and so could be considered cold-blooded, with certain hot-blooded exceptions like the [Hackney pony].  Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...

3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.  For example: """"when the coal mining industry became extensively developed in Britain in the 1800’s, Shetlands were imported in great numbers to haul coal cars in the 'pits'.""""

I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a """"single"""", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.

Fastfission, I welcome your thoughts on the article and examples. In defense, here is some reply to the most telling point (and heart of the method) The """"predictions"""" section puts the horse before the cart: Watson had already seen the B-form photograph before they thought of proposing the double helix. In Watson's Double Helix memoir, he clearly states that he and Crick had already worked out the mathematics of the Fourier transform of a Helix as an X-shape. They had come upon it with the TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and had already deduced TMV had a spiral shape. At the time of discovery (of structure of DNA) they did not know the orientation of the bases (inside or outside the helix) which Watson deduced by his concrete modelling of the nucleotide pairs. The discovery (of structure of DNA) came after, at least according to Watson's memoir. And Watson is still alive to clarify this for us. It is a golden opportunity for someone to ask and write down so that we can cite. But the article clearly states that scientific method is not linear, as you have well put. It is a horse-race between the steps, some of which can then be linearized after the moment of discovery, for publication. I do not mind the adjective lousy; in Feynman's words English is a lousy language, yet we somehow manage to communicate with it, and those of us who are prisoners of the tongue even attempt to think with it as well.

To determine the best way to test for a feature, refer to the documentation for the feature of interest. The following list discusses some common techniques for feature detection:
You can test for the presence of the functions associated with a feature. To test for the presence of a function in a system DLL, call the LoadLibrary function to load the DLL. Then call the GetProcAddress function to determine whether the function of interest is present in the DLL. Use the pointer returned by GetProcAddress to call the function. Note that even if the function is present, it may be a stub that just returns an error code such as ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
You can determine the presence of some features by using the GetSystemMetrics function. For example, you can detect multiple display monitors by calling GetSystemMetrics(SM_CMONITORS).
There are several versions of the redistributable DLLs that implement shell and common control features. For information about determining which versions are present on the system your application is running on, see the topic Shell and Common Controls Versions.
If you must require a particular operating system, be sure to use it as a minimum supported version, rather than design the test for the one operating system.

One of the Odin's ancestors came from the area of modern-day Turkey, and the X has been found in similarities to groups both in Sweden and ancient America, while the Adena mound sites have been found to be similar to those found in Sweden. The high-level of X found along the Atlantic-Artic travel routes suggest it could have came to the continent that way, but that is for archeologists to determine. See:

""""The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.""""

Possibly v1 & v2 also had Ones? The Architect speaks of the anomaly being ineradicable despite his best efforts, in which case it would be present in the eutopia and dystopia versions too.

If the claim is that this is to a large extent about precedence and enforcement of policies, then it may be better to not paint this as a polarized debate between two fractions. Granted, I believe there are two vocal parties on opposite sides of this debate, but  is right that there are intermediate positions as well. However, I'd like to stress again that this is not about which moves should be carried out. I don't think the ArbCom would ever consider deciding on which articles should be renamed. Rather, this is about what steps the community can take to ensure that global decisions (naming conventions) arrived at by consensus are not blocked locally (when deciding what title to use for a specific article), or what to do when local decisions run counter to more encompassing principles.

Forwarding is the process of actually sending data. It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.

Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as """"compact routing"""" . In these protocols nodes have unique names but not addresses.

The idea that one can distinguish the 'thesis' and 'theory' of intelligent design is puzzling. While I don't have access to Jones' Encyclopedia of Religion, there's an entry from 2003 (listed as 'forthcoming') on Dembski's list of writings on ID. Note that this is pre-Kitzmiller, and is typical of Dembski's writings of the time - Sagan, Paley and Kant. Assuming that this is substantially similar to the final version, there's nothing about thesis vs. theory.
Beyond this, John Carter appears to misunderstand the idea of """"theory"""". There are I think perhaps several other areas of what might be called """"theoretical biology,"""" such as parts of astrobiology, which also have a total lack of any hard evidence to indicate that they even have something real to study, in that case alien life. No. That's not what theoretical biology is. Take a look at the TOC of the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Or try Acta Biotheoretica. Or even check out the journal Astrobiology. Theory isn't about """"things that lack total evidence"""".
