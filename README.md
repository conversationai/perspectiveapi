# Perspective API documentation

<img align="right" src="img/perspective_icon-2020.png" alt="Perspective API logo" />Perspective is a free API that helps you host better conversations online. The API uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation. You can use this score to give feedback to commenters, help moderators more easily review comments, allow readers to more easily find interesting or productive comments, and more.
 
Perspective was created by Jigsaw and the Google Counter Abuse Technology team in a collaborative research initiative called [Conversation-AI](https://conversationai.github.io/). Check out [PerspectiveAPI.com](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/home) to learn more about the API.
