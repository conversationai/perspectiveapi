# Perspective Comment Analyzer API

The Perspective API is part of the
[ConversationAI](https://conversationai.github.io) research effort that
aims to help increase empathy, quality, and participation in online
conversation at scale.

This repo contains a [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) as well as the [API
reference documentation](api_reference.md) for the Perspective Comment Analyzer
API.

Note that the API is currently in trusted tester phase and not generally
available. Please see our [main site](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) for the
form to request API access.

If you would like to receive email updates about the API - for example when we
add new models, or deprecate old ones - you can subscribe to
[perspective-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/perspective-announce/join). You will
then receive emails updates from perspective-announce@googlegroups.com.
This list will be used only to share release information, and will never be
used to ask you login details of any kind.
