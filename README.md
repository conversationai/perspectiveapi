# Perspective Comment Analyzer API

The Perspective API is part of the
[Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io) research effort that
aims to help increase empathy, participation and quality in online
conversation at scale.

This github repository contains a [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) and the [API
reference documentation](api_reference.md) for the Perspective Comment Analyzer
API.

Note that the API is currently in trusted tester phase and not generally
available. Please see our [API demo and access request site](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) for the
form to request API access.

In addition to scoring comments, users can leverage the ‘SuggestCommentScore’ method to submit corrections to improve Perspective over time or can use the  ‘DoNotStore’ flag to ensure that all submitted comments are automatically deleted after scores are returned.

Example demo code:

 * [A simple server](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-simple-server)
   that can hold your API key and access the Perspective API.
 * [An example of an authorship
   experience](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-authorship-demo)
   gives an author feedback as they type.
 * [A proxy to the API](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-proxy)
   with access restrictions and a simple UI to debug calls to the API. 
 * [Conversation AI - Moderator](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator) 
   a comment moderation system that provide hint and assist UI for moderators based 
   on a plugable model of computational assistants, including support for using 
   Perspective API models. There are also plugins to support moderation of different platforms, e.g.:
   * [plugin for Discourse](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-discourse)
   * [plugin for Wordpress](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-wordpress)
   * [plugin for Reddit](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-reddit)
     (incomplete, does not yet support actions)
