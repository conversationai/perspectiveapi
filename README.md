# Perspective Comment Analyzer API

The Perspective API is part of the
[Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io) research effort that
aims to help increase empathy, participation and quality in online
conversation at scale.

This github repository contains a [quickstart guide](quickstart.md) and the [API
reference documentation](api_reference.md) for the Perspective Comment Analyzer
API.

Note that the API is currently in trusted tester phase and not generally
available. Please see our [main site](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/) for the
form to request API access.

Example demo code:

 * [A simple server](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-simple-server)
   that can hold your API key and access the Perspective API.
 * [An example of an authorship
   experience](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-authorship-demo)
   gives an author feedback as they type.
 * [A proxy to the API](https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi-proxy)
   with access restrictions and a simple UI to debug calls to the API. 
 * [Conversation AI - Moderator](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator) 
   a comment moderation system that provide hint and assist UI for moderators based 
   on a plugable model of computational assistants, including support for using 
   Perspective API models. There are also plugins to support moderation of different platforms, e.g.:
   * [plugin for Discourse](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-discourse)
   * [plugin for Wordpress](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-wordpress)
   * [plugin for Reddit](https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-moderator-reddit)
     (incomplete, does not yet support actions)

add new models, or deprecate old ones - you can subscribe to

This list will be used only to share release information, and will never be
used to ask you login details of any kind.
