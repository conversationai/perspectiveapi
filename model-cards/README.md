# Perspective API Model Cards

Model Cards are short documents that go alongside publicly available machine 
learning models to share information that model users should know such as 
intended usage, model training processes, and evaluation results, including 
evaluation across demographic groups and communities to measure unintended bias.
Model Cards were introduced at the 2019 
[Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency* Conference](https://fatconference.org/index.html) 
in *[Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287596)*
by M. Mitchell et al.

See our [TOXICITY model card](English/toxicity.md) and our [model card blog post](https://medium.com/the-false-positive/increasing-transparency-in-machine-learning-models-311ee08ca58a) for more information.
