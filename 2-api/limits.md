# Limits and errors

The Perspective API uses limits and quotas to protect the system from receiving
more data than it can handle, and to ensure equitable distribution of the
system resources. These limits and quotas are subject to change.

You may encounter an error if your request exceeds the limit.

## Quota limit

By default, we set a quota limit to an average of 1 query per second (QPS) for
all Perspective projects. This limit should be enough for testing the API and
for working in developer environments.

Check your quota limits by going to
[your Google Cloud project's Perspective API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/quotas),
and check your project's quota usage at
[the cloud console quota usage page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas).

If you're running a production website, you may need to
[request a quota increase](https://support.perspectiveapi.com/s/request-quota-increase).

## Character limit for requests

You may encounter the following error:

```
$ Comment text too long.
```

The maximum text size per request is 20 KB. One character does not
necessarily equal one byte, as different characters have different
encodings. Note that the models are trained on online comments, so
performance will be best on text around that length.

[Read the W3C guide on character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding).


## Other errors

Here are some examples of other errors you may encounter.

#### Comment is empty

```
$ Comment must be non-empty.
```

Comments queried must contain content.

#### Languages not supported

```
$ Attribute <attr_name> does not support request languages: <lang1, lang2>
```

The request for `<attr_name>` in `<lang1>` and `<lang2>` is not possible
because we do not yet support it. Read more about the
[available languages](models.md#specifying-language).

#### Unknown language

```
$ Unable to detect language
```

We are unable to detect what language is being used in the comment. Read more
about the [available languages](models.md#specifying-language).


#### Missing requested attribute

```
$ Missing requested_attributes
```

#### Unsupported score type for attribute

```
$ Requested score type <score_type> is not supported by attribute <attr_name>
```

The score type is not currently available for the attribute.

#### Unknown attribute

```
$ Unknown requested attribute: <attr_name>
```

#### Requests specifying unsupported formats

```
$ Currently, only 'PLAIN_TEXT' comments are supported
$ Unknown text type
```

Perspective API only supports plain text.

#### Invalid context

```
$ Context can have either entries or article_and_parent_comment, but both fields were populated.‚Äù
```

Comments submitted for review have been incorrectly formatted, including both `entries` and `article_and_parent_comment`.


#### General errors

For several common error cases, we provide an enum (called `ErrorType`) in the
`error_type` field that describes the cause of the error:

``` 
COMMENT_TOO_LONG
COMMENT_EMPTY
NO_REQUESTED_ATTRIBUTES
LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_ATTRIBUTE 
LANGUAGE_DETECTION_FAILED
```

Any other request format error is given `INVALID_REQUEST`.
